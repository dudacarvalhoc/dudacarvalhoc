### 💫 My Projects  

- 🐕 **WatchPet** - 4th semester of university
  ➜ This is our current project. Designed for both domestic and agricultural pets, it includes a smart collar that lets you track your pet's sleep quality, blood pressure, heart rate, GPS location, and more. An app that lets you access all the information the collar provides about your pet and sends alerts if your pet has left your property or is stolen. A website designed solely to showcase our product's capabilities—just ads, packages, and incredible information.

  ➜ A project still in progress, but with the objective of setting up a cosmetics store, from reports, Apex programming, triggers, dashboards, etc.
